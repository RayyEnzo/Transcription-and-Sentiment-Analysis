# 🎧 Audio Sentiment Analysis with WhisperAI & NLP

This project transcribes spoken audio into text using OpenAI’s **WhisperAI** and then classifies the sentiment of that text as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using NLP techniques. It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from voice input to emotion classification, all containerized via Docker for easy deployment.
